## Backstory
I thought my projects had to have a "home" so I made my very own portfolio page for ease of seeing my projects.

## Development
This project was done with:
- React
- Tailwind
- React Icons
- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

Challenges:
- Took me a while to figure out how to map an object and render it as an element.
- Framer Motion is responsible for the animations. I had to manually set or configure animations on each element I wanted to animate which is ineffective and takes way too much time. At the moment I haven't figured out to "store" those animations' configurations
